# Current-weather-Data
In this project, I used Python on AWS EC2 to connect to the OpenWeatherMap API and get the current weather information for the city I am interested in. I set up everything on the EC2 instance, installed the required Python tools, and created a special Python program to easily talk to the OpenWeatherMap. By doing all this, the project allowed me to get and show the latest weather details for my chosen city. It shows how Python can smoothly work on AWS EC2 to grab weather data.

The commands we used for installation on our EC2 instance are given below:
1. sudo apt update
2. sudo apt install python3-pip
3. pip install pandas
4. pip install requests
